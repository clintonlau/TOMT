       " 'description': 'Frying fish at home can be intimidating, not least because it’s messy and can leave the house smelling like a grease pit. Here, though, is a recipe that takes the cooking outside, to a large pan set over a propane hob or, as subsequent testing has borne out, to a large roasting pan filled with oil set over a gas grill. Simply heat the oil until it is very hot but not yet smoking, and add to it very fresh strips of fish dipped in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper and Old Bay, then into egg, and finally into panko, and fry until golden brown on each side, super-crisp, with a moist, tender and perfectly cooked interior. Buy a lot of fish. This is one of those recipes where people tend to want seconds and thirds. Serve with slaw and, if you like, tartar sauce.',\n",

Drain and allow to cool for a few minutes., Make the spicy red salsa: Place tomatoes, onion, cilantro, chile, garlic, cumin, oregano, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt into a blender or food processor and blitz until completely smooth. Pour the purée into a saucepan, add the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until darker in color and slightly thickened, while you prepare the remaining ingredients., Place the cooled potatoes in a bowl and roughly mash them. (It does not have to be smooth; a chunky texture is great.) Add the Cheddar, cilantro, garlic, cumin, paprika and 1 teaspoon sea salt and mix to combine., Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and, working in batches, add the corn tortillas and heat until soft and pliable. Remove from the pan and cover the tortillas with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm. Fill each warmed tortilla with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture, then fold in half and press down lightly., In the same skillet, add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and warm over medium-high heat. Place three or four tacos in the oil, pressing down lightly with a spatula so that the edges are in the oil, and fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until golden and crispy. Flip them over and repeat on the other side. Repeat with the remaining tacos., Serve the tacos with the spicy red salsa and any of the optional serving suggestions. (The potatoes can be cooked and mashed 2 days ahead and stored in an airtight container in the fridge. The salsa can be made 2 days ahead and kept in the fridge.

Using a flat spatula, quickly flip each piece of stuffing. Cook the other side until browned and crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate., In the same skillet, melt the 2 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat until foamy. Add the sliced turkey breast, flipping occasionally until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper., Assemble the sandwiches: Evenly spread 2 tablespoons of cranberry mayonnaise on 1 side of each slice of bread. Divide the buttery sliced turkey over the 4 slices of bread. Divide half the assorted leftovers on top of the white meat, then top each with a slab of crisp stuffing., On top of the crisp stuffing, evenly divide the gravy-dressed dark meat and the remaining assorted leftovers.

Combine fruit, sugars, mint and lemon juice. Cover and leave on the counter for 1 hour., Stir pineapple mixture and discard the mint. Add mixture to a heavy nonreactive pan and simmer slowly, stirring regularly, for about an hour, until sauce is very thick and clear and has reached 220 degrees., Add rum. Stir until mixture is thick and clear again, about 5 minutes. Sauce will keep 3 months in the refrigerator or a year if processed., To process, put a rack in a large stockpot or line the pot with a folded kitchen towel, then fill the pot with water and bring to a boil. Add 4 half-pint canning jars and boil for 10 minutes. Jars may be left in the warm water in the pot until ready to be filled. Alternatively, sterilize the jars by running them through a dishwasher cycle, leaving them inside until ready to fill., Place canning rings in a small saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Turn off heat and add the lids to soften rubber gaskets. Rings and lids may be left in the water until jars are filled., Remove the jars from the water bath and ladle hot sauce into warm jars, leaving 1/2-inch of headspace. Run a plastic knife gently around the inside of the jar to remove any air bubbles. Recheck the headspace., Wipe jar rims clean with a damp towel. Place the lids on the jars, screw on the rings and lower the jars back into the pot of boiling water. Return to a full boil and boil for 15 minutes. Transfer jars to a folded towel and let cool for 12 hours. You should hear them ping as they seal., Once cool, test the seals by removing rings and lifting jars by the flat lids. If a lid releases, the seal has not formed. Unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used within 3 months, or reprocessed. Rings and jars may be reused, but a new flat lid must be used each time.]  \n",

Bring an inch or two of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan. In a heatproof mixing bowl that will fit on saucepan, combine egg, egg yolks, honey and ginger. Place bowl over simmering water, and whisk mixture until pale and thick; do not allow to overheat, or mixture will curdle. Remove from heat and set aside., Using an electric mixer, or by hand, whisk cream just until stiff peaks form. Fold egg mixture into cream, and pour into loaf pan. Fold plastic so it covers top of pan, and place in freezer until solid, at least 3 hours., To serve, remove semifreddo from pan and plastic wrap, place on a chilled platter, and scatter about half the diced ginger over top.

       "3251   [Grease a 8- or 9-inch square baking pan with butter, then line it with parchment paper, covering the bottom and 2 sides with one sheet, creasing it into the corners to ensure a snug fit. If the stuffing is cold, warm it in the microwave for 1 minute or covered in a 350-degree oven for 15 minutes., Put the stuffing into the prepared pan and press into an even layer using an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. Top with a sheet of parchment and press firmly with your hands, tightly compacting the stuffing. If you have a second pan of the same size, use that to pack down the stuffing. Cover and chill overnight., The next day, prepare your sandwich fillings: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and cranberry sauce. Set aside., In a small saucepan, combine the shredded dark-meat turkey and the gravy. Gently heat over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, about 5 minutes., In a large nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high, warm the oil until hot and shimmering. (The stuffing needs to be cooked hot and fast, or it will stick to the skillet and fall apart.) Meanwhile, remove the stuffing from the pan by lifting the parchment overhang, and cut the stuffing into four squares., Cook stuffing until browned and crisp on one side, gently pressing it down using the base of the baking pan you chilled it in, about 1 minute. Using a flat spatula, quickly flip each piece of stuffing. Cook the other side until browned and crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate., In the same skillet, melt the 2 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat until foamy. Add the sliced turkey breast, flipping occasionally until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper., Assemble the sandwiches: Evenly spread 2 tablespoons of cranberry mayonnaise on 1 side of each slice of bread. Divide the buttery sliced turkey over the 4 slices of bread.

Sprinkle in baking powder, salt and baking soda into the batter, one at a time, whisking vigorously after each addition., Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in flour until just incorporated. The mixture will be lumpy, but that’s OK. Don’t overmix. Scrape batter into the skillet over the fruit and spread evenly., Bake until surface is deeply browned all over (with darker brown edges) and the fruit is lightly bubbling around the sides of the skillet, about 35 to 45 minutes, rotating halfway through. A toothpick inserted into cake will come out clean., Once the cake is out of the oven, immediately run a butter knife or offset spatula around the edge of the skillet. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes to cool slightly. Carefully invert cake into serving platter. If some fruit sticks to bottom of skillet, gently remove using offset spatula or knife and place back onto cake. Let cake cool until the fruit topping sets, at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, before serving. Cake is best served on the day it is baked.]  \n",
